# asir_lll
LLL-reduction and enumeration lattice algorithms for Risa/Asir language.

In the file, Lattice.rr, has some lattice algorithm. Here are example:

lll(B, D)

LLL-reduction algorithm.
B is lattice basis matrix(each row vector is basis vectors), and D is reduction parameter.


deeplll(B, D)

Deep LLL-reduction algorithm.
B is lattice basis matrix(each row vector is basis vectors), and D is reduction parameter.
